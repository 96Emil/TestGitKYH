        >>>Let's create a webshop
        1. Link bootstrap 5.x.x via CDN and its corresponding scripts
            Get from here => https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/
            links go in the <head> tag, scripts go right before the ending </body> tag.
        2. Fork the following project <<https://github.com/musicollins/TestGitKYH>> and clone
            it on your local machines
        3. Choose a team leader, which will be the one to fork the project and add the others
            as collanborators. This is done via Settings => Manage Access on the forked repo page
        4. Plan your work and pay attention to the specifications below...
        
        >>>SPECS
        5. The store will have a proper Home page with information about the store and the products
            sold in it. Apart from the Home page, there'll be a Products, Contact and About page
        6. The Content of these pages will be generated dynamically by listening to clicks on the 
            Navbar buttons which in turn will update the "innerHTMl" property of the "container" div,
            id est, <div class="container main">
        7. The Products page will also be dynamic and the products need to be injected into
            the "container" div by iterating through a Javascript array of objects, see the script.js file.
        8. Use Bootstrap "Classes" to style and center your components properly.
        9. Use template literals to dynamically create components with a mix of JS and Strings
        10. Don't forget to also create a footer and a proper Bootstrap responsive Navbar
        11. Google everything, brainstorm and if you don't find the answer ASK RAFAEL!!!
